# advent-of-code-kotlin

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [me][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

For more details, please refer to this JetBrains [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/11/advent-of-code-2021-in-kotlin/).

In this repository, I will try to provide solutions for some puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

I am also planning to blog my progress [here](https://ericlloyd.net/), feel free to follow along.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
